The two files currently named: scalarPSFnew.m and vectorialPSFnew.m were originally named
scalarPSF.m and vectorialPSF.m
There is a problem in compiling the c-codes in the subfolder mex so both files had to be renamed this
way for the system to use scalarPSF.mexw64 and vectorialPSFnew.mexw64 instead of the m. files
There has been an unexplained error in the c-compiler of this laptop and has given a lot of trouble.
This renaming files seem to be the solution for now.
